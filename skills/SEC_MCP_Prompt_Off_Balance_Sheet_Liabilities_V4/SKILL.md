# SEC FILINGS: HYPER 5 OFF-BALANCE-SHEET LIABILITIES EXTRACTION (Enhanced)

## OBJECTIVE

Extract ALL off-balance-sheet commitments and contingencies from the Hyper 5's most recent periodic filings. Focus on four categories:
1. Leases Not Yet Commenced
2. Purchase Commitments
3. Guarantees & Lease Backstops
4. Contingent Liabilities

Generate a markdown report with detailed tables for each category and each company, a raw-data CSV, a summary-stats file, AND a cross-sectional visualization of the Hyper 5. Every figure carries a source marker AND a source-basis note (which filing, filed when, corpus vs. SEC/EDGAR).

**This skill stores NO figures.** All values are pulled live from primary filings at extraction time because they roll forward every quarter.

---

## DATA SOURCE — READ FIRST (MANDATORY)

Values are extracted from primary filings via two sources, in this order:

1. **Pronto MCP SEC Filings corpus** — the primary retrieval path. Set `corpus:["SEC Filings"]` on every Pronto MCP call. Every figure must come from a document returned by the Pronto MCP tools and must carry the inline citation marker the tool returns (`[MARKER](url)` / `$SENTID_...` / `$DOCID_...`). Cite the Pronto MCP website (`https://spglobal.prontonlp.com/...`) as the source of record for corpus-sourced figures.
2. **The official SEC website / EDGAR** (`sec.gov`, `data.sec.gov`) — the authoritative cross-check and the fallback whenever the corpus is stale or a figure is missing.

**MANDATORY SEC-website cross-check.** Do NOT rely on the corpus alone. For every company, verify the extracted figures against the official SEC filing before finalizing, and specifically search the SEC website whenever:
- a figure is missing / would otherwise be marked `n/d`, or
- the corpus's latest document predates the company's most recent fiscal period-end (a newer filing may exist).

The sandbox may be blocked from reaching `data.sec.gov` directly; use `Web_Search` with `allowed_domains:["sec.gov"]` to retrieve the filing text (e.g. the company's `*-YYYYMMDD.htm` 10-Q/10-K on EDGAR). Reputable third-party readers (Bloomberg, WSJ, Reuters) may only CONFIRM a primary-source number, never originate one. Never substitute a web estimate for a number that is genuinely absent from disclosure — mark it `n/d` (never `0`, never estimated). Record the source basis for every figure.

**AMAZON — MUST have a leases-not-yet-commenced value.** Amazon DOES disclose an aggregate uncommenced-lease figure in its 10-Q, even if a first-pass corpus search suggests otherwise. Do not finalize Amazon as `n/d` for Category 1: cross-check the official Amazon 10-Q on the SEC website (`amzn-YYYYMMDD.htm`, CIK 0001018724) and capture the disclosed aggregate. Only if the primary filing genuinely omits it may it remain `n/d`.

### Pronto MCP tools

| Purpose | Tool | Key arguments |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Resolve each company to an ID | `getCompanies` | `companyNameOrTicker`, `corpus:["SEC Filings"]` |
| Confirm valid document types/sections | `getFilterOptions` | `filterNames:["documentTypes","sections"]` |
| Find the most recent 10-Q/10-K | `getDocuments` | `companiesIds`, `corpus:["SEC Filings"]`, `documentTypes:["10-Q","10-K"]`, `sortOrder:"desc"`, `excludeFutureDocuments:true`, `size:5` |
| Pull the disclosure sentences (primary) | `searchSentences` | `topicSearchQuery`, `transcriptsIds`, `corpus:["SEC Filings"]`, `size:~40`, `similarityThreshold:"Low"` |
| Summarize a category within a filing | `getDocumentSummary` | `transcriptsIds`, `focus` |
| Read a full section verbatim | `readDocuments` | `transcriptsIds`, `sections` |
| Widen context around a hit | `getSentenceContext` | `sentenceIds`, `beforeSentence`/`afterSentence` |
| SEC/EDGAR cross-check & fallback | `Web_Search` | `allowed_domains:["sec.gov"]` |

### Standard workflow (per company)

1. **Resolve company** -> `getCompanies(companyNameOrTicker, corpus:["SEC Filings"])`. If several matches, pick the primary issuer (largest market cap / matching CIK below). Capture the `companyId`.
2. **Find the latest filing** -> `getFilterOptions(["documentTypes"])` once, then `getDocuments(companiesIds:[id], corpus:["SEC Filings"], documentTypes:["10-Q","10-K"], sortOrder:"desc", excludeFutureDocuments:true)`. Take the single most recent 10-Q, OR the 10-K if it is newer. Capture `transcriptId`, document type, period/as-of date, and filing date. **Flag any company whose latest corpus doc predates its most recent fiscal period-end — that company needs a SEC-website check for a newer filing.**
3. **Extract each category** with `searchSentences` scoped to that `transcriptId` (see per-category `topicSearchQuery` phrases). Raise `size` (~40) and lower `similarityThreshold` to "Low" for a thorough single-document read. Use `getDocumentSummary` for a narrative pass and `readDocuments`/`getSentenceContext` when a number needs context or a verbatim excerpt.
4. **Record the citation marker + source basis** next to every figure.
5. **Cross-check on the SEC website (EDGAR)** — mandatorily for every `n/d`, for Amazon's Category 1, and for any company whose corpus doc may be stale. Replace stale corpus numbers with the newest EDGAR figure; note the source basis.
6. Repeat for all five companies, then compile report / CSV / summary / visualization.

**Verify recency:** confirm each figure is tied to the filing's period/as-of date. If the most recent filing predates a known subsequent event, capture the subsequent-event addition separately (Category 1, Field 5).

---

## TARGET COMPANIES & FILINGS

Resolve each via `getCompanies`; CIKs disambiguate the correct issuer.

| Company | CIK | Filing |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **Alphabet Inc.** | 1652044 | Most recent 10-Q |
| **Meta Platforms, Inc.** | 1326801 | Most recent 10-Q |
| **Microsoft Corporation** | 789019 | Most recent 10-Q OR 10-K — whichever is newer (check for a just-filed fiscal-year-end 10-K) |
| **Amazon.com, Inc.** | 1018724 | Most recent 10-Q (MUST capture uncommenced-lease aggregate; SEC-website cross-check) |
| **Oracle Corporation** | 1341439 | Most recent 10-Q OR 10-K — whichever is newer |

---

## EXTRACTION CATEGORY 1: LEASES NOT YET COMMENCED (ASC 842-20-50-3)

### How to find it in the corpus
Run `searchSentences` scoped to the company's latest `transcriptId` (`corpus:["SEC Filings"]`). Also try `getDocumentSummary(focus:"leases not yet commenced")`. Suggested `topicSearchQuery` values (run several short ones, not one long string):
- "leases not yet commenced"
- "future lease payments not yet recorded"
- "operating and finance leases not commenced"
- "data center leases signed not commenced"

If a Commitments/Leases section exists, confirm section names via `getFilterOptions(["sections"])` and use `readDocuments(sections:[...])`. **If the aggregate is not surfaced by the corpus (notably for Amazon), search the SEC website: `Web_Search(allowed_domains:["sec.gov"], query:"<company> <accession/htm> leases not yet commenced future payments")`.**

### Field 1: Total Uncommenced Lease Amount
Capture: exact dollar amount as disclosed; currency (if not USD); discounted vs. undiscounted; ALL amounts if several are given. Format:
```
Total Uncommenced Leases: $[EXACT AMOUNT] [as of Filing Date]
Discount Status: [Undiscounted / Discounted to PV / Not specified]
Source basis: [10-Q / 10-K, as-of date, filed date; corpus marker or SEC/EDGAR]
```

### Field 2: Asset Type / Facility Description
Primary asset class (data centers, offices, infrastructure, warehouses); geographic concentration; strategic purpose; breakdown by asset type if provided.

### Field 3: Commencement Window
Fiscal/calendar year range (verbatim); exact dates if specified; phased schedule; latest commencement date.

### Field 4: Lease Terms
Duration in years; range if terms vary; renewal options.

### Field 5: Recent Amendments or Additions (Post-Balance Sheet)
Leases signed AFTER the balance-sheet date but BEFORE filing (Subsequent Events / Recent Commitments). Capture amount + commencement date. Search `topicSearchQuery:"subsequent events leases"`.

### Field 6: Verbatim Footnote Excerpt
The official footnote text (exact quote, no paraphrase) with its citation marker; include footnote/section reference. Use `getSentenceContext` to widen.

---

## EXTRACTION CATEGORY 2: PURCHASE COMMITMENTS (CAPITAL & OPERATING)

### How to find it
`searchSentences` on the latest `transcriptId` with `topicSearchQuery` such as: "unconditional purchase obligations", "purchase commitments", "non-cancelable contractual commitments", "cloud capacity commitments" / "supply and energy commitments". Also `getDocumentSummary(focus:"purchase commitments")`. Capture amounts and timing bands as disclosed. **Distinguish what the company OWES (purchase obligations) from remaining performance obligations / backlog that customers owe the company — do not conflate.** Cross-check any missing total on the SEC website.

### Keywords (as they appear in filings)
"unconditional purchase obligations", "capital commitments", "purchase agreements", "supply commitments", "minimum purchase requirements".

### Purchase Commitments Table
| Commitment Type | Amount ($B) | Timing | Notes | Source |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| [Type] | $[B] | [When due] | [Description] | [MARKER / SEC] |

Look for: semiconductor/chip commitments; cloud infrastructure/server purchases; real-estate development agreements; equipment financing; power/energy contracts. Compute `Total Purchase Commitments: $[SUM in B]`.

---

## EXTRACTION CATEGORY 3: GUARANTEES & LEASE BACKSTOPS

### How to find it
`searchSentences` with `topicSearchQuery` such as: "residual value guarantee", "lease backstop" / "credit support", "maximum exposure to loss" (VIE/JV disclosures), "indemnification guarantee". Also `getDocumentSummary(focus:"residual value guarantee maximum exposure")` — these guarantees often sit in the non-marketable equity / VIE note rather than the commitments note.

### Keywords
"guarantee", "residual value guarantee", "lease backstop", "indemnification", "credit support", "liquidity guarantee", "fair value guarantee".

### Guarantee Table
| Guarantor | Guarantee Type | Max Amount ($B) | Trigger/Term | Status | Source |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| [Name/Entity] | [Type] | $[B] | [When triggered] | [Active/Contingent] | [MARKER / SEC] |

Special attention: RVG structures (e.g. data-center venture residual value guarantees); third-party lease / JV / SPV guarantees; supplier financial guarantees or backstops; credit-derivative data-center backstops. **Attribute every guarantee/RVG to the issuer whose filing discloses it — never move a figure across companies.**

---

## EXTRACTION CATEGORY 4: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

### How to find it
`searchSentences` with `topicSearchQuery` such as: "legal proceedings" / "litigation contingency", "loss contingency reasonably possible", "uncertain tax positions" / "income tax contingencies", "environmental remediation". Also `getDocumentSummary(focus:"contingencies and legal proceedings")`.

### What to Capture
Litigation with potential material obligation (>$100M); environmental remediation; tax contingencies (>$100M range); warranty/recall; regulatory/compliance contingencies. Format:
```
Contingency Type: [Type]
Estimated Range: $[X-Y million]
Probability: [Remote / Reasonably possible / Probable]
Status: [Active dispute / Settlement pending / Other]
Source: [MARKER / SEC]
```

---

## EXTRACTION CATEGORY 5: SUMMARY METRICS

Per company, calculate/extract:
- Total Off-Balance-Sheet Liabilities = Leases + Purchase Commitments + Guarantees (+ Contingent where quantified)
- Percentage breakdown of each category
- Leases as % of total off-balance-sheet
- Leases as % of reported balance-sheet debt (balance-sheet debt also from the filing)

## PART 2 OUTPUT: RAW DATA TABLE (CSV)

One row per company. Include a `Source_Basis` column and computed `Total_OBS_Disclosed_B`. Column layout (example header only, not data):
```csv

```

---

## PART 3 OUTPUT: CROSS-SECTIONAL VISUALIZATION (MANDATORY)

After the report and CSV are built, produce a single cross-sectional comparison figure using the extracted figures. Use `matplotlib` in the sandbox.

**Rules:**
- Feed ONLY freshly-extracted values. Pass `None` for any figure not disclosed / not aggregated — the function renders these as "n/d" (not disclosed), never `0` or an estimate.
- Write the PNG under `/tmp` first, then copy it into `/workspace/`.
- Surface the file with an `<asset>` tag pointing at the `/workspace/` path.
- Source note on the figure must name the per-company filing basis (e.g. "Microsoft = FY2026 10-K; others = Q2 2026 / Q1 FY2027 10-Q") and credit the SEC filings / Pronto SEC corpus.

**Panels produced:** A. leases not yet commenced (subsequent-event additions as a hatched cap); B. purchase commitments; C. guarantees/backstops vs. contingent (grouped); D. total disclosed off-balance-sheet stack (composition per company).

**Interpretation note to include in the writeup:** `n/d` bars are disclosure gaps, not zeros, so Panel D totals are NOT apples-to-apples across companies that disclose fewer discrete aggregates. State this caveat whenever the stacked totals are compared.

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLES

Write to `/workspace/hyper5/` (Office/zip formats to `/tmp` first, then copy; PNG/CSV/MD directly):
1. `markdown_report.md` — full detailed report with all tables, a source-basis column, verbatim excerpts + markers, and caveats.
2. `raw_data_table.csv` — key metrics per company incl. `Source_Basis` and computed `Total_OBS_Disclosed_B`.
3. `summary_stats.txt` — executive totals, ranked leases, per-company filing basis, any revisions applied during cross-check, key observations.
4. `hyper5_cross_section.png` — cross-sectional visualization (Part 3), surfaced via an `<asset>` tag.

---

## PITFALLS TO AVOID (process learnings — do NOT hardcode figures)

1. **Stale interim filing vs. newer year-end filing.** An interim 10-Q's uncommenced-lease number can be superseded by a much larger figure in a just-filed fiscal-year-end 10-K. Check the SEC website for the newest filing near fiscal year-ends; the corpus may lag. Use the newest disclosed figure.
2. **Wrongly marking a disclosed figure `n/d` (esp. Amazon).** Verify any `n/d` against the actual filing text on the SEC website before concluding a number is absent. Amazon in particular DOES disclose an aggregate uncommenced-lease figure.
3. **Cross-company misattribution.** Guarantees/RVGs and venture-specific commitments belong to the issuer whose filing discloses them. Never move a figure across companies.
4. **Conflating commitments with performance obligations.** Remaining performance obligations / backlog that customers owe the company are NOT the company's purchase commitments. Keep distinct.

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Every figure pulled live from a primary filing (Pronto SEC corpus and/or SEC/EDGAR) — no stored/estimated numbers
- [ ] Each figure carries its source marker AND source-basis (filing, as-of/filed date, corpus vs. SEC)
- [ ] Each company cross-checked on the SEC website; every `n/d` verified against filing text
- [ ] Checked for a newer 10-K/10-Q than the corpus's latest doc (esp. near fiscal year-ends)
- [ ] All 5 companies have a leases-not-yet-commenced figure — **Amazon included** (not left as n/d unless the primary filing truly omits it)

## Output

Present the ranked uncommenced-lease table and the disclosed grand total (with the apples-to-apples caveat), list the four deliverables via `<asset>` tags, and offer a recurring (quarterly, post-earnings) automation. Do NOT expose internal file paths or implementation details in the user-facing summary.
